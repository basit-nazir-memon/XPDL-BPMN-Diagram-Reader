# C++ XPDL BPMN Diagram Entities Reader and Cycle Time Analyzer

The C++ XPDL BPMN Diagram Entities Reader and Cycle Time Analyzer is a project written in C++ using Visual Studio 2022. It allows you to parse XPDL files containing BPMN diagram entities and analyze their cycle times. The project utilizes the RapidXML library for parsing XML files.

## Features

- XPDL Parsing: The program reads XPDL files and extracts BPMN diagram entities, including tasks, gateways, and events.
- Cycle Time Analysis: The analyzer calculates the cycle time for each BPMN diagram entity based on its start and end timestamps.
- Visualization: The program provides options to visualize the parsed BPMN diagram entities and their cycle times.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- RapidXML library (already included in the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/basit-nazir-memon/XPDL-BPMN-Diagram-Reader.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build the project to compile the source code.

## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable or debug the project in Visual Studio.
2. Provide the path to your XPDL file when prompted by the program.
3. The program will parse the XPDL file and extract the BPMN diagram entities.
4. It will then analyze the cycle time for each entity based on the start and end timestamps.
5. After the analysis, the program will provide options for visualizing the parsed entities and their cycle times.
6. Follow the instructions on the console to navigate through the visualization options and view the results.
